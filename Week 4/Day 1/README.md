# Week 4: Day 1 Session

In today's assignment, we'll be creating Synthetic Data, and using it to benchmark (and improve) a LCEL RAG Chain.

- 🤝 BREAKOUT ROOM #1
  1. Use RAGAS to Generate Synthetic Data

- 🤝 BREAKOUT ROOM #2
  1. Load them into a LangSmith Dataset
  2. Evaluate our RAG chain against the synthetic test data
  3. Make changes to our pipeline
  4. Evaluate the modified pipeline
