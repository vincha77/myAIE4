        "1. Using the phrase 'step-by-step reasoning' in the system prompt led the model to generate a response with a series of numbered bullet points.  Anecdotally, additional ancillary information unrelated to the question was also included in the response such as the location of Mount Everest, and the fact that the climb is dangerous, etc.  I'm guessing that this is due to the system prompt that mentioned the role 'expert at world geography'.\n",
        "2. The response differs significantly if the system prompt states 'expert in world geography' versus 'good knowledge of world geography'.  In the former case, there's a lot of additional detail, but in the latter case the response simply focuses on the mountain height.\n",
        "3. posing the user prompt as a question: \"Is Mount Everest the tallest mountain in the world? Which is the tallest mountain in the world?\" provided a more nuanced response, namely, that the tallest mountain could either be Mt Everest or Mauna Kea, depending on the way the height of a mountain is measured.  Also, in this case, there is no additional detail provided in the response."
