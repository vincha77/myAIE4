        "\n",
        "Due to the inclusion of cycles over loops, we can also compose rather complex flows through our graph in a much more readable and natural fashion. Effectively allowing us to recreate application flowcharts in code in an almost 1-to-1 fashion.\n",

        "### Why LangGraph?\n",
        "\n",
        "Beyond the agent-forward approach - we can easily compose and combine traditional \"DAG\" (directed acyclic graph) chains with powerful cyclic behaviour due to the tight integration with LCEL. This means it's a natural extension to LangChain's core offerings!"

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through\\na frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank\\nAdapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all\\nprevious openly released models on the Vicuna benchmark, reaching 99.3% of the\\nperformance level of ChatGPT while only requiring 24 hours of finetuning on a\\nsingle GPU. QLoRA introduces a number of innovations to save memory without\\nsacrificing performance: (a) 4-bit NormalFloat (NF4), a new data type that is\\ninformation theoretically optimal for normally distributed weights (b) double\\nquantization to reduce the average memory footprint by quantizing the\\nquantization constants, and (c) paged optimziers to manage memory spikes. We\\nuse QLoRA to finetune more than 1,000 models, providing a detailed analysis of\\ninstruction following and chatbot performance across 8 instruction datasets,\\nmultiple model types (LLaMA, T5), and model scales that would be infeasible to\\nrun with regular finetuning (e.g. 33B and 65B parameter models). Our results\\nshow that QLoRA finetuning on a small high-quality dataset leads to\\nstate-of-the-art results, even when using smaller models than the previous\\nSoTA. We provide a detailed analysis of chatbot performance based on both human\\nand GPT-4 evaluations showing that GPT-4 evaluations are a cheap and reasonable\\nalternative to human evaluation. Furthermore, we find that current chatbot\\nbenchmarks are not trustworthy to accurately evaluate the performance levels of\\nchatbots. A lemon-picked analysis demonstrates where Guanaco fails compared to\\nChatGPT. We release all of our models and code, including CUDA kernels for\\n4-bit training.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-05-27\\nTitle: Accurate LoRA-Finetuning Quantization of LLMs via Information Retention\\nAuthors: Haotong Qin, Xudong Ma, Xingyu Zheng, Xiaoyang Li, Yang Zhang, Shouda Liu, Jie Luo, Xianglong Liu, Michele Magno\\nSummary: The LoRA-finetuning quantization of LLMs has been extensively studied to\\nobtain accurate yet compact LLMs for deployment on resource-constrained\\nhardware. However, existing methods cause the quantized LLM to severely degrade\\nand even fail to benefit from the finetuning of LoRA. This paper proposes a\\nnovel IR-QLoRA for pushing quantized LLMs with LoRA to be highly accurate\\nthrough information retention. The proposed IR-QLoRA mainly relies on two\\ntechnologies derived from the perspective of unified information: (1)\\nstatistics-based Information Calibration Quantization allows the quantized\\nparameters of LLM to retain original information accurately; (2)\\nfinetuning-based Information Elastic Connection makes LoRA utilizes elastic\\nrepresentation transformation with diverse information. Comprehensive\\nexperiments show that IR-QLoRA can significantly improve accuracy across LLaMA\\nand LLaMA2 families under 2-4 bit-widths, e.g., 4- bit LLaMA-7B achieves 1.4%\\nimprovement on MMLU compared with the state-of-the-art methods. The significant\\nperformance gain requires only a tiny 0.31% additional time consumption,\\nrevealing the satisfactory efficiency of our IR-QLoRA. We highlight that\\nIR-QLoRA enjoys excellent versatility, compatible with various frameworks\\n(e.g., NormalFloat and Integer quantization) and brings general accuracy gains.\\nThe code is available at https://github.com/htqin/ir-qlora.\\n\\nPublished: 2024-06-12\\nTitle: Exploring Fact Memorization and Style Imitation in LLMs Using QLoRA: An Experimental Study and Quality Assessment Methods\\nAuthors: Eugene Vyborov, Oleksiy Osypenko, Serge Sotnyk\\nSummary: There are various methods for adapting LLMs to different domains.

QLoRA backpropagates gradients through a frozen, 4-bit quantized pretrained language model into Low Rank Adapters~(LoRA). Our best model family, which we name Guanaco, outperforms all previous openly ... Fine-tuning large language models (LLMs) is a common practice to adapt them for specific tasks, but it can be computationally expensive. LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique that makes this process more efficient by introducing small adapter modules to the model. These adapters capture task-specific knowledge without modifying the original ...\", name='duckduckgo_search', tool_call_id='call_PGJqLNoG1RQhMTTNTQXwxNUA'),\n",

Today we're joined by Luke Zettlemoyer, professor at University of Washington and a research manager at Meta. In our conversation with Luke, we cover multimodal generative AI, the effect of data on models, and the significance of open source and open science. We explore the grounding problem, the need for visual grounding and embodiment in At the core of Lumos is a Scene Text Recognition (STR) component that extracts text from first person point-of-view images, the output of which is used to augment input to a Multimodal Large Language Model (MM-LLM). While building Lumos, we encountered numerous challenges related to STR quality, overall latency, and model inference. Provost Tricia Serio and President Ana Mari Cauce have appointed a Task Force on Artificial Intelligence to address these issues and to suggest a UW-wide AI strategy.

              "'RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. It is a technique used in natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning to improve the performance of language models by combining retrieval-based methods with generative models. Here‚Äôs a brief overview of how it works:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval**: In the first step, the system retrieves relevant documents or pieces of information from a large corpus or database. This is typically done using a retrieval model, such as BM25 or a dense retrieval model like DPR (Dense Passage Retrieval).\\n\\n2. **Augmentation**: The retrieved documents are then used to augment the input to the generative model. This means that the generative model has access to additional context or information that can help it produce more accurate and relevant responses.\\n\\n3. **Generation**: Finally, the generative model, such as GPT-3 or BERT, uses the augmented input to generate a response. The additional context provided by the retrieved documents helps the model generate more informed and contextually appropriate responses.\\n\\nRAG is particularly useful in scenarios where the generative model alone might not have enough information to produce a high-quality response, such as in open-domain question answering, customer support, and other applications requiring access to a large knowledge base.'"

              "   'output': \"A Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system is a type of artificial intelligence model that combines retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to improve the quality and relevance of generated text. Here's a breakdown of the components and how they work together:\\n\\n1. **Retrieval Component**: This part of the system is responsible for fetching relevant information from a large corpus of documents or a database. It uses techniques from information retrieval to find documents or passages that are most relevant to the input query. This can involve traditional search algorithms, embeddings, or other methods to match the query with relevant content.\\n\\n2. **Generation Component**: Once the relevant information is retrieved, the generation component takes over. This is typically a language model (like GPT-3) that generates coherent and contextually appropriate text based on the retrieved information. The generation model uses the retrieved documents as context to produce more accurate and informative responses.\\n\\n3. **Integration**: The RAG system integrates these two components in a way that the retrieval step informs the generation step. The retrieved documents provide a rich context that the generation model can use to produce more relevant and accurate text. This integration can be done in various ways, such as concatenating the retrieved documents with the input query before feeding it into the generation model.\\n\\n### Benefits of RAG Systems\\n- **Improved Relevance**: By leveraging a retrieval step, the system can access a vast amount of information, making the generated responses more relevant and accurate.\\n- **Up-to-date Information**: Retrieval from a dynamic and up-to-date corpus ensures that the generated content is current and reflects the latest information.\\n- **Efficiency**: Combining retrieval with generation can be more efficient than training a generation model on a massive dataset, as the retrieval step narrows down the relevant information.\\n\\n### Applications\\n- **Question Answering**: RAG systems can provide more accurate answers by retrieving relevant documents and generating responses based on them.\\n- **Customer Support**: They can assist in customer support by retrieving relevant knowledge base articles and generating helpful responses.\\n- **Content Creation**: RAG systems can help in creating content by retrieving relevant information and generating coherent text based on it.\\n\\nOverall, Retrieval Augmented Generation systems represent a powerful approach to combining the strengths of retrieval-based and generation-based models to produce high-quality, relevant, and informative text.\",\n",

              "   'output': 'LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) is a technique used in machine learning, particularly in the context of fine-tuning large pre-trained models. Here are some significant improvements and benefits that LoRA provides:\\n\\n1. **Parameter Efficiency**: LoRA significantly reduces the number of trainable parameters required for fine-tuning. Instead of updating all the parameters of a large model, LoRA introduces a small number of additional parameters, making the process more efficient.\\n\\n2. **Memory Efficiency**: By reducing the number of parameters that need to be updated, LoRA also reduces the memory footprint during training. This is particularly beneficial when working with very large models that would otherwise require substantial computational resources.\\n\\n3. **Faster Training**: With fewer parameters to update, the training process can be faster. This allows for quicker iterations and experimentation, which is valuable in research and development settings.\\n\\n4. **Modularity**: LoRA allows for modular updates to the model. This means that different tasks can have their own low-rank adaptations, which can be combined or swapped out as needed. This modularity is useful for multi-task learning and transfer learning.\\n\\n5. **Maintaining Performance**: Despite the reduction in the number of trainable parameters, LoRA has been shown to maintain or even improve the performance of the fine-tuned model. This is achieved by effectively capturing the task-specific information in the low-rank adaptations.\\n\\n6. **Scalability**: LoRA is scalable to very large models, making it a practical solution for fine-tuning state-of-the-art models with billions of parameters.\\n\\n7. **Cost-Effectiveness**: By reducing the computational and memory requirements, LoRA makes it more cost-effective to fine-tune large models. This can be particularly important for organizations with limited resources.\\n\\n8. **Flexibility**: LoRA can be applied to various types of neural networks and is not limited to a specific architecture. This flexibility makes it a versatile tool in the machine learning toolkit.\\n\\nThese improvements make LoRA a powerful technique for fine-tuning large pre-trained models, enabling more efficient and effective adaptation to specific tasks.',\n",
