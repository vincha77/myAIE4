### Steps to Run:

1. Create a Python 3.11 environment
2. `pip install jupyter` so you can run the notebook
3. Run through the notebook. 

# Build 🏗️

Run the notebook ([Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1DiSVcScZ_ys9_6Tl1_bPIHfJVYb_MlkS?usp=sharing)) and complete the following:

1. Breakout Room #1:
  - Task 1: Dependencies
  - Task 2: Loading Our Model
  - Task 3: Loading Our Data
  - Task 4: Setting Our Signature
  - Task 5: Creating a Predictor
  - Task 6: Making a Chain, I mean...Module
  - Task 7: Evaluate
  - Task 8: Program Optimization
2. Breakout Room #2:
  - Task 1: Defining Appliation
  - Task 2: Hyper-Parameters and Data
  - Task 3: Signature And Module Creation
  - Task 4: Evaluating Our LongFormQA Module
  - Task 5: Adding Assertions


## ADVANCED BUILD:

Use `DSPy` to create a tool-use Agent based on the [AvaTaR: Optimizing LLM Agents for Tool-Assisted Knowledge Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11200) paper.
