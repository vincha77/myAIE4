However, smaller chunk-sizes can be really problematic if the query is broad-based as the context may get too large and/or chunks are completely missed because they are not at the right level of aggregation semantically.  Thus, one might imagine multiple vector stores and the user's query is directed to the right one depending on an analysis of the query submitted by the user."
