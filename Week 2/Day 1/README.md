# Deploying Pythonic RAG!

Building off last week, we're going to take our Pythonic RAG application to the next level!

## Getting Started

This week, we'll be working out of the [AIE4-DeployPythonicRAG repository](https://github.com/AI-Maker-Space/AIE4-DeployPythonicRAG)!

> NOTE: IT IS CRITICAL THAT YOU DO NOT CLONE THE NEW REPOSITORY INTO YOUR EXISTING AIE4 REPOSITORY. THIS WILL CAUSE MANY HEADACHES AND GIT-RELATED SADNESS.

Clone the repository with the command: 

```bash
cd ~
git clone git@github.com:AI-Maker-Space/AIE4-DeployPythonicRAG.git
```

Navigate to that repository - and follow the instructions!
